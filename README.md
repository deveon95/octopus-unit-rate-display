# esp-idf-json
Example of JSON Serialize and Deserialize with ESP-IDF.


ESP-IDF includes [this](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) cJSON library (Version: 1.7.12).   
You can use JSON components as standard.   
But the documentation is very poor.   
The official documentation for the JSON component is [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components/json/README).

[Here](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/blob/master/tests/readme_examples.c) is a example by Dave Gamble.

# How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-json

```
